# Butterfish Bubbles Module

Butterfish uses the excellent [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) framework to statefully render in Console Mode, i.e. keep a persistent console window open which updates with state changes. But we needed additional functionality outside the standard [Bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles) library. This module contains several submodules with individually-loadable Bubble Tea components.
